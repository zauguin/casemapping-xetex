# TECkit based tailored Unicode case mapping

A script to generate TECkit files implementing uppercase/lowercase casemapping
according to Unicode with tailorings as provided in LaTeX,
optionally combined with tex-text mappings for classical TeX ligatures.
Designed for the TeX engine that shall not be named.

Requires LuaTeX and luaotfload during build time.

I strongly recommend to to use this but to switch to LuaLaTeX instead.
